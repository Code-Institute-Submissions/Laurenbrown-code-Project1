# Front page

## Hero image and About section

On the Front page of the website you will find the hero image and two sections of information. The hero image is of a singing bowl and animation has been applied to this image to catch the eye of the user. I took the idea to use a hero image with animation from the Love Running Project i completed during the one of the modules in the code institute course, i thought it was a good way to add an extra layer of interest to the website. 

The first section of information is the About section, here the user with find out more about the Meditation Club there is also some information on a few of the benefits of meditation and there is information about the Meditation Club Membership scheme and there is also a link to the sign up page.

## Classes section
The second section of the information on the front page is the Classes section. This is where the user will find out which day of the week each class is held, what time the classes are run and in which room within the Meditation club each class takes place. 

I also chose to style this section of the page in a same way I was taught to style a section of the Love Running project as liked how clear and easy to read the information was presented.
